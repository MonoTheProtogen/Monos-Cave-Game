My own version of Minecraft, made on Minetest, written completely from scratch, using Minetest Game as a base.
Currently very work in progress, still trying to figure out Minetest API.



# Installation

## Stable Release

### Any platform

Go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/MonoTheProtogen/Monos-Cave-Game/releases), download the latest **release** package and unzip it into your Minetest `games` directory.

After this the game should show up in Minetest.


## Latest Versions (possibly unstable)

Go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/MonoTheProtogen/Monos-Cave-Game/releases), download the latest **pre-release** package and unzip it into your Minetest `games` directory.

After this the game should show up in Minetest.


## Latest Dev Versions (90% likely to be very unstable as well as possible inclusion of continuity errors)

### Any platform

Download the source code as a zip and unzip it in your Minetest `games` directory.

After this the game should show up in Minetest.



### Linux / Windows(with Git installed) (maybe also Mac idk I've never used it)

Open your Minetest `games` directory in the terminal, then use this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/MonoTheProtogen/Monos-Cave-Game
```

After this the game should show up in Minetest.
